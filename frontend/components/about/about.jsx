                    Throughout my life I have prioritized studying and living in countries and cities I have never visited. 
                    New languages and cultures don't scare me, they fascinate me. As a child of two nationalities, growing up, and attending school in three continents, I've always sought out experiences that differ from my own. 
                    My profession as a Software Engineer, compliments my way of thinking about life experiences. Technology is being developed and updated everywhere all the time. 
                    Programming languages extend across all borders, and having studied programming across continents I've had to adapt to how various communities favor one technology over another. 
                    My current fascination lies with React, Redux, and React Native for my frontend, and Ruby on Rails as my backend. These technologies, among others such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, and Ruby, are skills I've mastered. 
                    After working with vanilla javascript, jQuery and various other libraries, they are among my favorite tools to design with.
